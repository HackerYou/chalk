# Chalk

This is the repo to house all tools related to the HY Classroom Management system. All related content and files are to linked through this doc for easy reference.

This tool is to be used within HackerYou by all members of a classroom and instructors as a way to manage lessons, content and news. This tool is meant to replace the current Jekyll build tool that is protected through Github oAuth.

## Styleguide

The styles for the app exist within the `styles` directory. The base styles are compiled using PostCSS through the Gulpfile. To work within the gulp production files, run `gulp styleguide`.

The live styleguide will be located at [http://localhost:3000/app/styleguide](http://localhost:3000/app/styleguide)

All the production files for the base CSS are kept in `app/styles/dev`. Further component styles will exist within the `app/components/**componentname**/` folder.
